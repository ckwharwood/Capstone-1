    <h1>About Me</h1>
    <hr />
    <p>Howdy! I'm Jesse, a passionate and detail-oriented tech developer with a strong foundation in full stack web development. 
        I thrive on turning complex problems into elegant, efficient solutions, 
        and I enjoy the challenge of learning new technologies to enhance my skills.
        I’m particularly skilled in building multi-layer solutions for small businesses, thriving upstarts, and seasoned entrepreneurs. 
        As the consumer base continues to show exponential growth on the internet, 
        my clients know they can always count on me to use my tools and knowledge to create a 
        masterpiece of technological design suited perfectly for all of their needs.
        Whether I'm tasked with building responsive, user-friendly and accessible web applications using React.js and Node.js or 
        developing scalable back-end systems with Django and PostgreSQL. 
        My projects reflect my commitment to clean, maintainable code and user-centered design.
    </p>
    <p>My journey in software development began as a hobby in my teen years, where I found myself captivated by the technology blossoming around me.
        I was enamored with the idea of creating something from nothing, and I quickly realized that coding was the perfect medium for my creative impulses.
        I started learning basic coding languages like C++, Python and Java, and as I grew more comfortable with the syntax and structure of programming,
        I began to take on freelance projects for friends and family. Eventually, my hunger for challenge and growth led me to pursue more complex projects and knowledge.
        I enrolled in a coding bootcamp to deepen my understanding of web and app development, and I haven't looked back since. 
    </p>
    <p>Over the years, I’ve developed a diverse skill set that includes front-end and back-end technologies, 
        as well as experience with database management, cloud services, and version control.
        Beyond coding, I’m a strong advocate for continuous learning and collaboration.
        I enjoy contributing to open source projects, participating in coding communities,
        and working in agile teams where I can share knowledge and grow alongside my peers.
    </p>
    <p>When I'm not coding, you can find me engrossed with new music, audiobooks, or recent releases of video games.
        While my favorite variety is horror, I am a huge fan of all genres and love to explore new worlds and stories.
        My favorite conversations to have are about combat sports, poker and other table games, and new advances in vehicular technology.
        I also enjoy staying active in the gym with a group of friends, cooking up new recipes at home, and exploring the great outdoors.
        These activities help me stay balanced and inspired, fueling my passion for the growing field of tech.
    </p>
    <p>I’m currently looking for opportunities to join a dynamic team where I can contribute to innovative projects 
        and grow as a full stack developer. I’m excited to bring my skills and enthusiasm to a new challenge and make a meaningful impact.
        Feel free to explore my portfolio to see some of the projects I've worked on.
